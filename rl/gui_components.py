Class for window/toolbar management

The main app shows two game-tree images side by side:

   * Representation of v(s), small boxes w/a 2d embedding like the game 
     graph, color indicating value.

   * Representation of delta-V(s), V_{t+1)(s), etc.  accumulating updates 
     to be applied at the end of the epoch in batch mode, or the current
     update in online mode, etc.

Beneath these is a toolbar setting the different options for the RL algorithm.

   * Speed-setting: determines when learning pauses and waits for the user's
     signal to proceed.  Speed control has four mutually exclusive settings:
      * Stop after each state updates.
      * Stop after every state updates (an epoch).
      * Stop after state updating converges, between policy iterations.
      * Run continuously (until policy stability).
      
    (NOTE that the speed control settings will depend on the RL algorithm being used. 
    The class for the algorithm should provide the GUI class with a list of settings,
    the action buttons for each setting.  User interactions w/the gui will call the
    algorithm's callback with the current setting & button pressed etc.)

   * Action buttons:  "Go/Stop" or "Step" button (depending on speed setting & current state)

   * Other toggles: 

      * highlight updating states, (box around states visited since last frame)

      * Show updating states.  Instead of color boxes, show the game state images
        of the state being updateed and the states in which the update information 
        originates and the edges between states.  Put these images in the same locations
        as their color box representations, but slightly larger.

      * SHow policy changes:  Every policy update, show a new window with all/some of
        the policy changes.  Each policy change is displayed as a game state image with
        the old move in red and the new move in green.
